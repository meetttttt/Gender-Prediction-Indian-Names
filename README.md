# Introduction 
- A Gender prediction project on Indian Names using LSTM model.

# Problem Statement:
- We need you to build a model that, given Indian names, can predict their gender.
- You can use any training dataset for this that you can find.

# Suggested Solutions:
- Create LSTM Model to predict gender based on name(Indian name).

# Future Work:
Remove the repeated names.
Take only first name instead of the full name.
Add more names.
fix null values instead of removing them.
Try other models.
